### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Jsantana5/Jsantana5** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting a bachelors at WGU
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux and Networking!
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on writing a program to translate configs to Cisco
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to spend as much time outside as I do infront of a computer.
